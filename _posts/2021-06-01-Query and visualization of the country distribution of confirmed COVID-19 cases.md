### Introduction
The COVID-19 epidemic is closely related to everyone's life. Faced with the massive amount of data generated by various media every second, it is challenging for people to form a comprehensive understanding of it with human brains. Structured query language (SQL), however, can precisely meet this demand under the function of data definition. This mini-project focuses on the realization of two following functions: **checking the country with the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases as of the specified date and visualizing the number of cases in some key countries**, by using SQL, direct operation user interface, and heat map to realize information interaction and knowledge production.

### Software Design
The software adopts a direct operation user interface and is made based on the pygame and pyecharts packages of Python programming language. Users can run the software via different applications, such as command prompt, then open a simple initial interface, which provides a line of prompts and a button that is designed to be clicked to enter the date specified by the user. Type in a regulated date (in the form of Year-Month-Day) and press Enter, then the interface will return the country with the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases till that day and the corresponding number. Besides, the software will generate an HTML file containing a world map (an example shown in Fig. 1), intuitively showing COVID-19 situation of the day in some key countries (China, US, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, and Iran).

### Database Design
The database files used in this project are countries-aggregated_csv.csv and key-countries-pivoted_csv.csv, downloaded from <https://datahub.io/core/covid-19>. According to the data features of these databases, table ONECOUNTRYCONFIRMED and KEYCOUNTRYCONFIRMED were created. Detailed attributes and relationships representing by the entity-relationship diagram (ERD) are shown below (Fig. 2).
The tables in this project are satisfied amidst the first normal form (1NF), and the query efficiency is relatively high. The date entered by the user is used as the foreign key and a constraint, to participate in data querying in tables.

### Input
The user needs to type the date in the form of Year-Month-Day, which should be greater than or equal to 2020-01-22 and less than or equal to today's date.

### Output
The user interface outputs the country with the largest number of confirmed cases till that day and the number of cases. An HTML file reflecting the COVID-19 situation of 8 key countries on that day will be generated in the same directory of Python code, containing a world map in the form of a heat map.

### Limitations
The relational model of this project has a certain degree of redundancy since it only satisfies 1NF. For example, the number of confirmed cases in the two tables overlaps. However, there are discrepancies in databases from different information sources, so the relationship between two tables cannot be easily set up (for example, the values of ONECOUNTRYCONFIRMED.ConfirmedCases cannot be used instead of that of table KEYCOUNTRYCONFIRMED). Furthermore, the database involved in this project is relatively simple, and the query algorithm complexity is relatively low. These defects do not affect the normal function of the software. In fewer entity relationships, the idea of functional dependency analysis can improve query efficiency, whereas, in larger entities and more complex relationships, the balance of non-redundancy and query efficiency should be considered.
Due to lack of time, the project is rough, so as the user interaction. Although the heat map is intuitive to use, it is highly fragmented with the user interface and leads to a bad experience.
